Hi, my name is Andres Alcocer and I am a self-taught JavaScript Developer. I am currently living in Durham, North Carolina. I enjoy working in the frontend world of web development but I aim to become a fullstack developer. I am currently learning how to develop react and node applications. The main purpose of this blog is to track my journey of becoming a fullstack developer and to put useful information out there for developers like me. If you need a project or just want to chat please don't hesitate to contact me!
